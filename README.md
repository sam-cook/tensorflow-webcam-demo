## Tensorflow example

This is a simple app that streams video from your webcam to be analysed by
Tensorflow. Tensorflow will identify various objects in the video frame it has
been sent, and we then use a canvas element to draw boxes around these elements.

### Notes

- For best results please use Chrome
- This is just a proof of concept / WIP, do not take any of the code here as
  production ready
